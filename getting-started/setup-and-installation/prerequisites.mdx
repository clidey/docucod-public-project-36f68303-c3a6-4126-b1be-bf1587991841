# System Requirements & Prerequisites

Before setting up the GDG Glasgow Landing Site locally, ensure your development environment meets the essential tools and system versions outlined below. Satisfying these requirements guarantees a smooth installation and development experience.

---

## 1. Supported Node.js Version

- The GDG Glasgow site is built using Node.js, specifically targeting version **8.x**.
- You must have Node.js version 8 installed globally on your system.

### How to check your Node.js version:

```bash
node -v
```

- Expected output should start with `v8` (e.g., `v8.17.0`).

### Installing Node.js v8:

- Visit the [official Node.js downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) and select version 8.
- Use Node Version Manager ([nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)) for easier management of multiple Node.js versions:

```bash
nvm install 8
nvm use 8
```

<Tip>
Although Node.js 8 is an older version, it matches the build environment specified in the projectâ€™s CI configuration (.travis.yml). Using the required version avoids build or runtime incompatibilities.
</Tip>

---

## 2. npm (Node Package Manager) Requirements

- npm is bundled with Node.js.
- Use the npm version that comes with Node.js 8 to ensure compatibility.

### Check npm version:

```bash
npm -v
```

- Typically, npm 5 or 6 accompanies Node 8.

<Tip>
If you encounter npm errors during dependency installation, ensure your npm version aligns with Node 8 or update npm appropriately using `npm install -g npm@5` or `npm install -g npm@6`.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Git Version Control

- Git is essential to clone the repository and manage the source.

### Prerequisites:

- Install Git version 2.x or higher.
- Verify installation by running:

```bash
git --version
```

- Output should resemble `git version 2.x.x`.

### Installing Git:

- Download & install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

---

## 4. Additional Tools & Environment

### Development Environment
- A modern terminal or command prompt to execute commands.
- Sufficient disk space (~200MB) for repository and dependencies.

### Network Access
- Internet connection is required during setup to download Node packages for dependencies.
- Ensure no firewall or proxy blocks npm or Git connections.

| Requirement      | Recommended Version / Details            | Command to Verify                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Node.js          | v8.x (e.g., v8.17.0)                   | `node -v`                                 |
| npm              | Compatible with Node 8 (npm 5 or 6)    | `npm -v`                                  |
| Git              | v2.x or higher                         | `git --version`                           |
| Internet Access   | Unrestricted access for downloads      | N/A                                       |

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues & Solutions">
<Accordion title="Node.js Version Mismatch">
- **Problem:** Output of `node -v` is not version 8.x.
- **Solution:** Use `nvm` to switch Node versions or uninstall current Node and install v8.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="npm Install Fails">
- **Problem:** Dependency installation errors.
- **Solution:** Clear npm cache with `npm cache clean --force`, ensure network is accessible, and try again.
- Verify correct Node and npm versions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Git Not Found">
- **Problem:** `git` commands not recognized.
- **Solution:** Install Git from the official site and restart your terminal.

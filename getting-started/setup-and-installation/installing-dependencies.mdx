# Installing Dependencies

This guide walks you through the essential steps to clone the GDG Glasgow Landing Site repository, install all necessary third-party packages, and prepare your environment for local development using npm.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing dependencies, ensure your system meets the following prerequisites:

- **Node.js**: Version 8.x is required. Verify by running:
  ```bash
  node -v
  ```
- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js. Confirm installation with:
  ```bash
  npm -v
  ```
- **Git**: Used to clone the repository. Check with:
  ```bash
  git --version
  ```

If any are missing or versions are incompatible, install or update them before proceeding.

<Tip>
Use the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download Node.js (v8.x) and npm, and [Git downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for Git installation.
</Tip>

## 2. Cloning the Repository

Get the project's source code by cloning it from GitHub.

### Steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to place the project.
3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GDG-Glasgow/gdg-glasgow.com.git
   ```
4. Change to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd gdg-glasgow.com
   ```

<Check>
Ensure the `gdg-glasgow.com` directory appears and contains files like `README.md` and `package.json`.
</Check>

## 3. Installing Dependencies Using npm

The project uses npm to manage third-party packages and dependencies. Installing these is essential for the site to build and run locally.

### Steps:

1. Inside your project directory, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all required libraries into the `node_modules` folder.

2. Wait until the installation completes successfully. You should see messages about installed packages.

<Info>
`npm install` must be run whenever dependencies change or when setting up the project for the first time.
</Info>

## 4. Verification of Installation

After installing dependencies, verify your environment is ready.

### Simple Check:

Run the following to confirm npm can access the installed packages:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This command starts the local development server (see [Running the Site Locally](/getting-started/setup-and-installation/first-local-run) for more details). If the server starts and you see messages like "Listening on port...", the environment is correctly set up.

<Tip>
If `npm run dev` fails, review errors. Missing or incompatible package versions often cause failures.
</Tip>

## 5. Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **npm command not found**: Confirm Node.js and npm are installed and added to your system PATH.
- **Permission errors during npm install**: Avoid running npm as root or administrator. Instead, fix permissions or use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing Node.js.
- **Outdated Node version**: Ensure Node.js is v8.x as required. Newer versions might create unexpected issues given the constraints.
- **Network issues**: If npm install fails due to network, check your internet connection or proxy settings.

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common npm Installation Issues">
<Accordion title="Package compatibility errors">
Ensure you have Node.js v8.x installed; newer versions may cause dependency conflicts. Switch using tools like `nvm` if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="npm cache problems">
Clear the npm cache by running:
```bash
npm cache clean --force
```
Then retry `npm install`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission denied errors">
Avoid running npm commands with `sudo` unless absolutely necessary. Fix permissions on your project directory or use a Node version manager.

## 6. Next Steps

- Proceed to run the site locally using `npm run dev` to start the development server.
- Explore editing and contributing by creating a new branch for your features or fixes.
- Consult the [System Requirements & Prerequisites](/getting-started/setup-and-installation/prerequisites) page to validate your setup.

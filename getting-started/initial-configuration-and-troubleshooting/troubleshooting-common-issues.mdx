# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This page helps you resolve the most frequent problems encountered during installation and the first run of the GDG Glasgow Landing Site. It provides practical, quick fixes for common npm errors, dependency conflicts, and issues starting the local server.

## 1. npm Installation Errors

When running `npm install`, you might see errors that prevent dependencies from installing correctly. Here's how to tackle them:

### Common Causes
- Outdated Node.js or npm versions
- Network connectivity or proxy issues
- Conflicts with existing modules or lock files

### Step-by-Step Fixes

1. **Verify Node.js and npm versions**
   
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

   The GDG Glasgow site requires Node.js **v8.x**. If your versions differ, update accordingly.

2. **Clear npm cache**
   
   Sometimes corrupted cache causes installation failures:

   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

3. **Delete `node_modules` and lock files**

   Remove existing dependencies to ensure a fresh install:

   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   ```

4. **Run installation again**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Check for network issues**

   If you’re behind a proxy or corporate firewall, configure npm proxy settings:

   ```bash
   npm config set proxy http://proxyaddress:port
   npm config set https-proxy http://proxyaddress:port
   ```

   Alternatively, try installing with a different network.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- If `npm install` still fails, review the error log displayed for clues on missing packages or permissions.
- Run npm commands with administrator privileges on Windows or use `sudo` on Unix systems if permission errors persist.
- Consult the official [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/) troubleshooting guides for deeper issues.

## 2. Dependency Conflicts

Conflicting dependency versions can cause `npm install` failures or unexpected behavior.

### How to Identify
- Errors mentioning version mismatches or peer dependency conflicts
- Warnings in the terminal about incompatible versions

### Resolution Steps

1. **Review `package.json` dependencies**

   Check for strict version pins or outdated packages.

2. **Update dependencies carefully**

   Use:
   ```bash
   npm update
   ```

3. **Manually adjust versions if necessary**

   Change versions in `package.json` to compatible ones, then run `npm install` again.

4. **Use `npm audit` to detect vulnerabilities**

   ```bash
   npm audit fix
   ```

   This will help fix known package issues.

> <Tip>
> Avoid manually forcing dependency installs or using `--force` flags without understanding the consequences, as it can break the site.

## 3. Local Server Won’t Start or Crashes

After `npm install`, starting the development server with `npm run dev` should launch a local web server to preview the site. If this fails:

### Check Node.js Version
The site requires Node.js v8.x; newer or older versions might cause issues.

### Typical Errors & Fixes

- **Port already in use**
  
  Error: `EADDRINUSE` indicates the default port (usually 8080) is busy.

  **Fix:**
  
  - Identify process blocking port, then terminate it.
  
  Unix:
  ```bash
  lsof -i :8080
  kill -9 <PID>
  ```
  
  Windows:
  ```powershell
  netstat -ano | findstr :8080
  taskkill /PID <PID> /F
  ```

  Or change the port by modifying dev server config (advanced).

- **Missing scripts in `package.json`**

  Verify `npm run dev` is defined in your `package.json`. If missing, ensure you have the right repo clone and files.

- **Syntax or build errors**

  Look for error messages specifying missing modules or syntax problems. Fix by:
  
  - Reinstalling dependencies
  - Ensuring the correct Node.js version

### Verifying Server Startup
- Upon successful start, the CLI should display running info, e.g., `Local server is running at http://localhost:8080`.
- Open that URL in a browser and verify the GDG Glasgow Landing Site loads.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Clear the terminal and rerun the start command to rule out transient issues.
- Check for active firewalls or antivirus software blocking local server connections.

## 4. Contact Form Malfunction

If messages sent through the site's contact modal fail to deliver:

- Check your internet connection as the form uses Formspree, a third-party service.
- Ensure the email address `gdgglasgow@gmail.com` configured for Formspree is active.
- If the modal doesn’t open or submit:
  
  - Confirm JavaScript is enabled in the browser.
  - Check the browser console for JavaScript errors.

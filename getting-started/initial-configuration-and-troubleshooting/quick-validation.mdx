# Quick Validation Checklist

Before you start contributing to the GDG Glasgow Landing Site or customizing it for your needs, this checklist ensures your environment is correctly set up and the application runs as expected. Completing these checks will save time and prevent common configuration issues.

---

## 1. Environment Verification

### Node.js Version
Ensure you have Node.js installed with version 8.x, as required by the project configuration.

```bash
node -v
# Expected output: v8.x.x
```

If you get a different version, please [download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) and install Node.js 8.x.

### npm Cache and Packages
Verify your npm cache is working and all dependencies install cleanly.

```bash
npm cache verify
npm install
```

Look for any errors during `npm install`. If there are problems, clear the cache and retry:

```bash
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```


## 2. Build and Test Run

Use the same commands configured in `.travis.yml` to emulate the CI build locally and confirm a successful build.

### Install Firebase Tools
The CI setup installs `firebase-tools` before building. Run this manually:

```bash
npm install firebase-tools
```

### Build the Project for Production
Build using the production script:

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

You should see the build output generated under the `/dist` directory without errors.

### Serve or Preview Locally
After build, preview the site locally by starting a simple static file server in the output directory.

Example using `serve` (install if needed):

```bash
npm install -g serve
serve dist
```

Open the served URL in your browser and verify the landing site appears correctly.


## 3. Deployment Confirmation

The project utilizes Firebase hosting for deployment. Confirm you're authenticated and ready to deploy:

### Firebase Project Setup
Make sure you have the Firebase CLI configured and the default project set to `gdg-glasgow-site`.

Check active project:

```bash
firebase projects:list
firebase use gdg-glasgow-site
```

### Environment Variable
Ensure your shell has the `FIREBASE_TOKEN` environment variable set to authorize deployment.

Set the token (replace with your actual token):

```bash
export FIREBASE_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

### Deploy Manually
Trigger deployment (this matches the `after_success` CI step):

```bash
firebase deploy --token=$FIREBASE_TOKEN
```

Confirm deployment succeeds and the site updates on https://gdg-glasgow.com.


## 4. Functional Checks

### Navigation and UI Elements
- Open the site and verify the navigation bar loads and links function.
- Ensure the contact form modal opens when clicking the envelope icon and can be closed.
- Confirm event slideshows rotate images automatically every 3.5 seconds.

### Assets and Styling
- Confirm Bulma CSS styling is applied correctly.
- The site uses the Fira Sans font from Google Fonts and FontAwesome icons.

## Bringing Events to Life

At the heart of the site is a dynamic event presentation that visually showcases upcoming and past gatherings. Whether it's an Evening Talk, a Study Jam, or the signature DevFest conference, the site highlights event details clearly and attractively.

- **Event Presentation**: Events are featured prominently with dates and direct links to more information, helping users quickly find activities to join.
- **Image Slider**: The site cycles through event-related photos in an elegant slider format, giving visitors a vivid sense of community activity and atmosphere.

**Example Scenario:** Imagine you’re a developer new to Glasgow interested in Google technologies. Upon visiting, you see upcoming events with enticing visuals rotating automatically, encouraging you to explore and sign up.

## Simplified Contact Mechanism

Connecting with organizers has never been easier. The landing page features a clean and accessible contact modal:

- **Modal Contact Form**: A seamless, non-intrusive popup form allows users to send queries without leaving the page.
- **Formspree Integration**: The form submits messages securely without requiring a backend server, making the communication straightforward and reliable.

**How it Helps:** Need to ask about event schedules or volunteer opportunities? Just click the contact icon, fill in your details, and hit Send—all handled effortlessly behind the scenes.

**User Flow:** Whether browsing from a phone on the go or from a desktop at work, users receive an equally smooth and accessible experience.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Frequently Encountered Issues">
<Accordion title="Contact Form Does Not Submit">
Check your internet connection and ensure JavaScript is enabled. The form uses Formspree, so interruptions in network connectivity could block submission.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Event Images Are Not Displaying or Not Changing">
Make sure your browser supports JavaScript and no extensions block scripts. The event slider depends on JavaScript to rotate images every 3.5 seconds.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Modal Window Does Not Close Using Escape Key">
Confirm focus is on the page and try clicking the close icon or clicking outside the modal area. Some browsers or assistive devices might behave differently; alternate closing methods are provided.

});

// Closes the modal when close button or Escape key is pressed
closeButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  contactFormModal.classList.remove('is-active');
});
document.addEventListener('keydown', (evt) => {
  if (evt.key === 'Escape' || evt.key === 'Esc') {
